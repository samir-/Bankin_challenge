# Bankin_challenge
A Scrapping Script for the website https://web.bankin.com/challenge/index.html

The idea is to load the page one time and execute a script to update the page in user side.
In the script, we handled the slowmode and the error alert by dismissing it.

Prequisities: 
- NodeJs
- puppeteer
- chrome headless

**Run** : 
node index.js

**Output :** 

JSON file containing all the transactions(4999).

** #Execution time [In my machine] **
- 3 seconds  With page loading 
- 1,5 seconds without
